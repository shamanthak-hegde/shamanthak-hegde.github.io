I am a first year Master's student at Arizona State University with a passion for Deep Learning and Machine Learning technologies. I am an enthusiast of learning and developing technologies that mimic humans. I have been working on some very interesting Multimodal learning: Vision and Language tasks which include Scene text understanding and Visual Question Answering.

In my undergraduate, I worked with Prof. Shankar Gangisetty on various projects in the VQA domain.

My Research Interests are:
Machine Learning | Deep Learning | Computer Vision | Natural Language Processing | Multi-modal Learning: Vision and Language
